**How to play the game**

The aim of the game is to match up pairs of cards.  It's a game that tests your memory. Click on any two cards - if they match, great, they'll stay facing up. If not, try another two cards. Keep going until all the cards are paired up. Can you remember where you last saw the cards? It's not as easy as it sounds, sometimes!
